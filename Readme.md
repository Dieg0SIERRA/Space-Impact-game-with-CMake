#      RETRO GAME SPACE IMPACT

This project is about the implementation of the video game "Space Impact".
At this moment (29/11/2023) this branch is functional but it is still a very simple game.
* The game is coded in C++-17 using only the STL library.
* The compilation was done with CMake.
* It is only available for Windows
* The game has only one level (the easiest one), that's the reason of "V1" in the name of the branch.

## Compilation instructions

For the compilation it is necessary to have CMake for windows installed.

1. Enter the project folder
2. Create a subfolder build `mkdir build/`
3. Enter the build sub-folder `cd build/`
4. Execute the CMake command : `cmake ..`
5. If successful, run the command make : `cmake --build .`
6. If the build was successful, go to the "Debug" folder and run the generated .exe file : `Space_Impact_CMake.exe`
7. Play!!!
